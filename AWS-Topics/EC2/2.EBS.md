# <center>Elastic Block Storage</center>

* A network drive(network USB Sticks) attached/can be attachable to your ec2 instance while they run
* Allows us to store persistant data from ec2 instance (data will not gone after instance shut down), However make sure that `Delete on termination` attribute is disabled while creating an EBS Volume or during creation of your instance to persist the data. This is enabled by default whenever you are creating a EC2 Instance and setting up your EBS Volume.
* For Cloud Practitioner Level, Only One EBS can be attached for a single instance
* Bound to AZ, however you can copy or migrate data to other AZ via snapshots
* You can expect some latency while communicating to and from instance to your network drive, as it is not a physical drive attached inside of ec2 instance

## EBS Snapshot

* Backup of your ebs volume at a point of time
* not necessary to detach a volume to take a snapshot, but recommended
* snapshots can be copied to other AZ / region
* **EBS Snapshot Archive** - This is used to move your snapshots to archive tier, which can cost you upto 75% cheaper, but the problem here is it can take 24-48 hrs for restoring the archive
* **Recycle Bin** - by default whenever you delete a snaphot, they are really gone. in order to prevent this enable recycle bin via rules to retain those deleted snapshots
