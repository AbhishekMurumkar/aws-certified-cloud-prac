# <center>Elastic Cloud Computing -- EC2 -- Infrastructure As A Service

* most popluar service
* comprises of
  * renting virtaul hardware -- EC2
  * stroing data on virtual harddrives -- EBS
  * distribure load - ALB/CLB
  * Scale the service using auto scaling group -- ASG
* Configurations and options available before

## <center> Types of ec2 instances [Click here for official link](aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

## Instance Naming Convention
m5.2xlarge means
* `m` is instance class (a general purpose type of instance)
* `5` is generation of instance (AWS Improves over time)
* `2xlarge` size within instance class

## <center>Types Include
1. ## General purpose (Instance class - t, m4, m5, m6)
   1. greatly used for web servers and code repos
   2. balance between compute, network and memory
2. ## Compute optimized (Instance class - c)
   1. Mostly used for high performance processes
   2. Batch Processing workloads
   3. media transcoding
   4. high performance web server
   5. high performance computing (HPC)
   6. Scientific learning and Machine learning
   7. Dedicated Gaming Servers
3. ## Memory optimized (Instance class - R,X, High Memory)
   1. Have a really good performance for operating under heavy data loads in memory
   2. high performance relational & non-relational databases
   3. distributed web cache stores -- Ex: Elastic Cache
   4. Great for In Memory Applications for Business Intelligence
   5. Apps performing real time processing of big unstructured data
4. ## Storage optimized (Instance class - I,D,H1)
   1. used when you are accessing lots of data on your local ec2 instances that needs high sequential read-write speeds
   2. Online Transaction Processing Systems (OLTP)
   3. relational & non-relation databases,
   4. data ware housing applications
   5. distributed file systems
   6. cache for in-memory databases

## <center>Security Groups

* Fundamental rules to protect aws services by keeping in check of what goes in and out of the aws network/ EC2 instance by gaining control over
  * Access of ports
  * IP Address allowed ranges (IPv4,IPv6)
  * control over inbound and outbound network
* However this component does live outside of your EC2 Instance
* Contain rules by
  * IP Addresses
  * Rules
  * other security group ( group can reference other security groups)
* ### These are the firewall of the EC2 Intances
* A Ec2 INstance can have multiple instances, in the same way a secuirty group can be attached to multiple instances
* They are locked to AWS Region/VPC
* ### Good to maintain separate secutiry group for SSH Access
* ### If you get <u>timeout error</u> when you are trying to access your application in internet, then it is probably due to security group issue
* ### If you get <u>connection refused error</u> when you are trying to access your application in internet, then it is probably due to a failure in your EC2 Instance or during its startup
* By Default, 
  * ALL Inbound traffic is blocked
  * ALL Outbound traffic is authorized

Ports to Remember
1. SSh -22
2. FTp - 21
3. SFTP - 22
4. HTTP - 80
5. HTTPS - 443
6. RDP - 3389 (Windows Remote Desktop Access)

### SSH Access to your EC2 INstance -- Access your EC2 Instance system in your local system's cli via this protocol. This involves
   1. creation of SSH Keys
   2. Attach an rule in your security group of your EC2 Instance to allow SSH Access
   3. Change the permission of SSH Key to 400 in linux & mac
   4. Try to SSH from your local system to EC2 Instance via command : `ssh -i <path of pem file> ec2user@< Public IP of your ec2 instance>`


Whenever you want to access your instance your EC2 Instance via SSH or AWS Cloud Connect, only when you are using your personal system.

## ***<u>Never ever store your access key and secret key info on your EC2 Instance or aws cloud connect (dont run aws configure on aws cloud connect nor dont run on your instance), as an intruder can get hold of those keys and misuse it.</u>***

The ALternative to access the services from your EC2 Instance is <u>IAM Roles</u>

## Purchasing Options

1. ## On Demand Instance.
   1. Good for short workloads and un-interrupted workloads(where you dont how your application will behaves)
   2. paid by no.of seconds used
   3. pridictable pricing
   4. has highest cost but no upfront payment
   5. no long term commit ment
2. ## Reserved Instances (1 & 3 Years)
   1. Good for large workloads
   2. Recommeded for databases & steady state usage 
   3. can give you upto 72% discount compared to On Demand
   4. you will reserve specific instance attribute
      1. instance type
      2. place (region or zone)
      3. tenancy
      4. os
      5. reservation period - 1 or 3 years
   5. Payment Options
      1. upfront
      2. partial upfront
      3. no upfront
   6. You can buy or sell your reserverd instances in AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace, when you dont need them
3. ## Convertible Reserved Instances
   1. The only difference of this from above is allow you change instance specific attributes over time
   2. can give upto 66% discount compared to on Demand
   3. long workloads with flexible instances
   4. can change instance type over time
4. ## Saving Plan (1 & 3 Years)
   1. More Modern plan
   2. commitment of specific instance type, amount of usage, long workloads (like $10/hour for 1/3 Years). Any usabe beyond saving plans will be billed under onDemand
   3. can give up to 72 % discount compared to onDemand
   4. Locked to specific instance family and AWS Region, but flexible acros
      1. Instance size
      2. OS
      3. Tenency
5. ## Spot Instances
   1. Have most aggresive discount, can offer upto 90% discount compared to on demand
   2. Here you will lose the instance if the your max price of instance exceeds current spot price of the instance
   3. can lose instance at any time(less reliable)
   4. Thus these are most cost effective and less reliable
   5. shorter workloads and applications doesnt affect on failures
   6. Good for batch processing, image processing, distributed workloads
   7. Not at all suited for critical application nor databases
6. ## Dedicated Hosts
   1. Allows to your book an entire physical server, control instance placement
   2. Allows you address compliance requirements and 
   3. use your existing server bound software license(per-socket, per-core, per-vm)
   4. These are most expensive of all instance types
   5. Purchasing options
      1. OnDemand
      2. Reserved
   6. useful for software having complicated licensing model (BYOL-Bring Your Own License)
7. ## Dedicated Instances
   1. Allows to book your ec2 instance, where no other customer will share your hardware
   2. Runs on hardware that is dedicated to you
   3. you have option to share that hardware with in your account
   4. This means having your own instance on your hardware, where are dedicated hosts mean you get to access physical server itself and it gives you visibility over lower level of hardware
8. ## Capacity Reservations
   1. reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration (no commitment over time)
   2. you can access EC2 Instance whenever you need  
   3. have no billing discount
   4. combine with regional reserved instance and  savings plan to benefit from billing discount
   5. You will be charged with ON Demand rate whether you run your instance or not
   6. suitable for short term workloads
