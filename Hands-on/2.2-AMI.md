# Create an AMI
(In here we launch an ec2 instance with httpd server)
1. Launch a new Ec2 Instance with given below user data content
   
   ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
   ```
2. Now from the ec2 console home, choose your instance -> click `Actions` -> `Image and Templates` -> `Create an Image`
3. give name for your image and leave rest with defaults -> click `Create`
4. You can view your AMI in ec2 console home -> Images -> AMI's
(then continue setting web page in another instance, so above instance is used to create an AMI and do some new changes on it)

# Launch new instances from an AMI
1. Launching Instance can be done in following ways,
   1. From above AMI, select it -> hit `Launch Instance from Image`
   2. From Ec2 Instance creation page, under AMI -> Select tab `My AMIs` -> `Owned By me` -> Choose your desired AMI from below dropdown and proceed furthur to create a image
2. Now In the user data section add below snippet, where we are editing default welcome page of httpd server

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "<h1>Hello world from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
## Now this determines that first we created a base instance, created a ami .. later we took the same AMI and used for the server function. In the later case, we skipped the installation of httpd server, thus helping us to make quicker boot of the system
